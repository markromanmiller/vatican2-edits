# vatican2-edits

Inspired by a video from James Donald Forbes McCann on the Vatican website, 
we're hoping to collect changes that need to be made to a website that we don't own but still care about. Those changes can be visible through a *content transformation proxy server* where pages are downloaded and edited for usability reasons before being sent to the client who requested them, or through web browser extensions.

The goal of this is to get the attention of whoever does the Vatican website and help them make some usability changes, like finding links that 404 and text that is misspelled.

Integrity is really important to us; these changes are limited to usability (e.g. links that 404) and very minor edits (e.g. missing spaces). Furthermore, these changes are visible when using either the proxy server or extensions.

Blessed Carlo Acutis, pray for us!
